$$\frac{\pi ^2 *r^2}{2}$$

##Write Formula##
$$\Phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.6180339887...$$
  
##Pythagorus Theorem##

$$a^2 +b^2 = c^2$$

##Exercise 5##

```{r}
divide = function(a,b){
  message("divide")
  return(a/b)
}
divide(8,2)
```

I define divide function with a and b. Also leaves message with divide and finally return with value which a divide by b. Thus 8/2 equals 4.
